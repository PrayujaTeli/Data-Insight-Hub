# VitalGuard Analytics

## Overview
This project aims to identify countries with high suicide rates and analyze potential contributing factors using various parameters. Data is collected from diverse sources, and enriched through analysis.

## Objective
The primary objective is to provide actionable insights to suicide prevention agencies, prioritizing interventions to save lives.

## How to Use
1. Open the file `Suicide_project.ipynb`.
2. Specify the correct directory path for datasets in the source code. For example:
   ```python
   directory_path = "C:\Users\prayujateli\Downloads\SuicideProject\\"
   ```
3. Run each cell sequentially.
4. Upon completion, find the preprocessed data in the file named `Final_merged_dataset.xlsx`.

## Potential Uses
- **Government Agencies:** Identify regions with high suicide rates and areas needing improvement, such as mental health facilities or expenditure.
- **Social Work Organizations:** Address demographics disproportionately affected by suicide.
- **Paramedics:** Assess demand for mental health services and adjust the workforce accordingly.
- **Suicide Hotline Providers:** Analyze trends in suicide rates across demographics.
- **Business Sector:** Incorporate mental health considerations into operations and employee support.

## Challenges & Constraints
- **Missing Data:** Certain parameters lack widespread reporting.
- **Assumptions:** Some variables were standardized using random values.
- **Data Formatting:** Inconsistencies in country names posed integration challenges.

## Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive dataset for stakeholders to assess suicide statistics worldwide. By identifying areas of concern, stakeholders can take proactive measures to mitigate suicide rates.
